In this hands-on tutorial, you'll set up Apache Superset with a PostgreSQL connection using Docker Compose. 

Superset is a powerful open-source tool for data visualization and exploration. 
Docker Compose simplifies running Superset and PostgreSQL in isolated containers with minimal setup. 
We’ll create a docker-compose.yml file to launch both services together. PostgreSQL will serve as Superset’s metadata database and data source. 
You’ll learn how to configure the connection between Superset and PostgreSQL inside Docker. 
By the end, you’ll have a ready-to-use environment for building interactive dashboards. 
This setup is ideal for quick prototyping or development without complex installs. 
Let’s get started and bring your data to life with Superset and PostgreSQL!
